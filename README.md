# GitHub Users and Repositories Data Analysis

This project involves scraping and analyzing data from GitHub users located in Tokyo with over 200 followers. The data includes user profiles and their public repositories, providing insights into developer activity and trends.

- I scraped the data using the GitHub API, fetching user profiles and their repositories based on specified criteria, including location and follower count.
- One surprising fact discovered was that a significant number of users had not updated their repositories in over a year, indicating potential inactivity or abandonment.
- I recommend developers regularly update their repositories and engage with the community to enhance visibility and collaboration opportunities.

## Conclusion

This analysis highlights the importance of maintaining active repositories on GitHub. By engaging more frequently, developers can improve their network and attract potential collaborators or employers.
